/* This program calculates the energy needed to heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature. 
This program prompts the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms and the initial and final temperatures of the water. 
The formula to compute the energy is
        Q = M * (finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature) * 4184
where M is the weight of water in kilograms, initial and final temperatures are in 
degrees Celsius, and energy Q is measured in joules.*/

        double finalTemperature = input.nextDouble();
        
        //create a variable to compute and store a value for the energy required
        double energyNeeded = amountOfWater * (finalTemperature - initialTemperature) * 4184;
        
        //display the result
        System.out.println("The energy needed is " + energyNeeded + "J");
        
        
    }
}

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
Enter the amount of water in kilograms: 55.5
Enter the initial temperature: 3.5
Enter the final temperature: 10.5
The energy needed is 1625484.0J
